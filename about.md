What does 'glasnt' mean?

> Back in the days of the Cold War, American secret service personnel
> has to be very careful about how they approached and contacted one
> another in public, the codename normally chosen was "Joe" being a very
> All-American name by which one could identify with any covert agent by
> saying "Hi Joe". Obviously this alone isn't enough to ensure the other
> person isn't just called Joe so the typical response would be "Hi
> Glasnt".
>
> The origin of glasnt has been broadly discussed, some people think
> it's short hand for "glad the country hasn't been attacked" or derived
> from the acronym "Generally low activity seriousness, no threats". At
> any rate, the phrase became something of a meme amongst former secret
> service/intelligence members as the codeword fell out of use but was
> held onto for nostalgia's sake.
>
> As for Joee and Glasnt on the forums, if you think they're just some
> kids trawling around on here reading comics, it's time to wake up and
> see how far down the rabbit hole goes...
