No really, what does "glasnt" mean?

*It was a word that came up on my Nokia 3310's predictive text, when I entered in the last 6 digits of my (now defunct) mobile number. It wasn't used anywhere on the internet at the time, so I used it as my handle when during the early GMail beta (2004), and [the rest is history](https://glasnt.com/blog/feelings-about-unique-usernames-on-the-internet). In it's original numeric form cast as a hexcode, it's a [very pretty colour of deep purple](https://www.google.com/search?&q=%23452768).*
