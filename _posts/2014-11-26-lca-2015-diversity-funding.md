AUCKLAND, New Zealand – Friday 21st November 2014 – linux.conf.au 2015 Organisers are proud to announce our funding programme!

### InternetNZ Diversity Programme

LCA 2015 and InternetNZ are proud to support diversity. The InternetNZ Diversity Programme is one of the many ways we ensure that LCA 2015 continues to be an open and welcoming conference for everyone. Together with InternetNZ this program has been created to assist under-represented delegates who contribute to the Open Source community but, without financial assistance, would not be able to attend LCA 2015.

For more information please see our funding registration page.
