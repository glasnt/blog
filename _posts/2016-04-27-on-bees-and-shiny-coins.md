If you've seen some of the buzz on Twitter, [BeeWare](https://github.com/pybee/) is a project that has been a hive of activity in the last few months. It's recently been covered on the [MaxCDN blog](https://www.maxcdn.com/blog/beeware-be-sticky/), which features [Russell](https://twitter.com/freakboy3742) talking about the very shiny coins which were minted via sponsorship from MaxCDN. 

It also mentions #LABHR, which is really cool too!
