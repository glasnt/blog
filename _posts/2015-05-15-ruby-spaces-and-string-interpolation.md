title: Ruby, Spaces, and String Interpolation
---

And the tablets were passed down from high upon the mountain, onto the waiting masses, where the decision as to the [spaces within a string interpolation in ruby](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide/pull/429) was decided. And the decision was to remove them. 

And thus it was canon. 

And thus the [peace keepers of the world](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/1836) did regale this decision with merriment, but had to take it into their hearts and their minds. And the [doctrine was updated](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/pull/1893), with checks and balances to ensure that the scripture was known and automatically corrected. 

And it was good.
