<p>New fangled multi-touch trackpads and Gnome actually work really well. You can, with some practice, use a trackpad with multi-touch (such as a Lenovo T440) without having to click.</p>
<blockquote><p>To click, tap on the touchpad.<br />
To double-click, tap twice.<br />
To drag an item, <strong>double-tap but don't lift your finger after the second tap.</strong> Drag the item where you want it, then lift your finger to drop.<br />
If your touchpad supports multi-finger taps, <strong>right-click by tapping with two fingers at once</strong>. Otherwise, you still need to use hardware buttons to right-click. ...<br />
If your touchpad supports multi-finger taps, <strong>middle-click by tapping with three fingers at once.</strong></p></blockquote>
