title: Emoji talk status update
subtitle: So I've been speaking about emoji a lot...
---
Way back in 2015, I had an inkling that I wanted to do a talk about unicode and
how terrible it was. Thankfully, through some very helpful mentoring, I refined this idea
into a talk/rant about emoji. 

Since March 2016, this talk has been given twelve times. 😱

 * Northern-most talk: Spokane (47.66° N, beating Budapest by mere minutes! (47.50° N)) 🌲 
 * Southern-most talk: Dunedin (45.88° S) ❄️
 * Language variations: five (Ruby, Obj-C, Python, PHP, Web) 💎 📜 🐍 🐘 🕸
 * Countries: four (Hungary, Australia, New Zealand, USA) 🇭🇺 🇦🇺 🇳🇿 🇺🇸
 * PyCons: Three (Australia, New Zealand, USA) 🐨 🥝 🥓
 * DjangoCons: All three ✨  (Europe, Australia (DjangoCon AU/PyCon AU), US) 🎷 🐍 🌲
 * Unicode versions released since first talk: two (Unicode 9.0 and Unicode 10.0) ✨
 * Emoji proposals submitted since first talk: two (Tropical Bird (recommended for Unicode 11.0 🎉), Coin (rejected 😭))

On top of the full "⚡️😓✨" version, I've given an [Ignite talk](http://www.ignitetalks.io/videos/emoji-are-broken), and a short talk on [hacking with emoji](https://twitter.com/attacus_au/status/835362125967044609), not to mention [writing about it](https://opensource.com/article/17/4/cross-platform-emoji)

This all being said, at this point, I'm ***not sure I'll present this again***

I've previously written about [talk
retirement](http://glasnt.com/blog/2016/06/07/on-talk-retirement.html), and
this one has had a good run. This isn't one of those talks I can just whip out
at a moment's notice, because every time I prepare this talk for it's next
outing, something in Unicode has changed and I need to update the slides. It
can be quite a bit of work. 

It's also getting to a point where it's a bit too common on a schedule. It's a
talk that people who go to many conferences would skip because they've already
seen it. It's different every single time, but the talk title stays the same. 

That being said, I ***love*** this talk. It's my absolute favourite talk I
give. I'd love to refresh it one day but I think after starting at DjangoCon
Europe and finishing at DjangoCon US, this might be time to hang it up. 

If there is a conference that would really like this talk (and they'll cover
travel/accom), do [let me know](mailto:katie@glasnt.com) and we can chat.
