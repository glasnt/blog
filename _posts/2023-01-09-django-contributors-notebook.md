title: Django Contributors - A Notebook
---

During the DjangoCon's Europe and US 2022, I was working on a little side project, based on the input of Carlton Gibson. 

He asked the question: "Who contributed to the last release of Django?". 

Carlton's own notes helped me work out "[What is a Django release](https://noumenal.es/posts/what-is-django-4/zj2/)", and from there, I was able to iterate. 

I've published the results of my sprint work in a [notebook, hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/glasnt/dceu2022-sprints-work/blob/latest/notebook.ipynb), which should a complete story about who contributed to Django 4.1. 

**This notebook won't be maintained**, but forms the basis of further work I have planned to provide a tool for the Django Fellows to generate this data for their Django release process. 

Watch this space :)
