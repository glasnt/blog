.. and here is where something interesting will go children. 

Now you see kids, a 'blog' or 'web-log' is like a journal you keep in a hard cover book with your little love-heart shaped lock. If anyone ever read your journal, you would be very very sad. However, blogs are journals of people who like to have their entire life, or what life they blog about, broadcast for all the world to see. 

Some people, however, like to just blog about things that interest them. These blogs may not be the most interesting of blogs, but they are still worth a look.

Look at my blog damnit!
