title: Dragon Age, and why it fails

I don't like World of Warcraft. Even before actually seeing the gameplay or even investigating the story line, I heard horror stories of people wasting away in front of their computer terminal, trying to further themselves in the make believe world of druids and wizards and hats, or whatever the classes are in that universe.

I never thought I would become a slave to a game, playing day in and day out. Heck, it was only because of my partner's experience with a similar MMO that I was only allowed to purchase and play Guild Wars after becoming employed, as opposed to installing an immersion experience that would negate any chance I had on the employment market.

Then I saw Dragon Age Origins. I thought I would give it a go, seeing as though I found Guild Wars to be alright, and dragons were just a deal sweetener. Since I purchased the game in late November, Steam informs me that I have wasted 261 hours of my life to this game. That's 65 hours a month, or about 16 hours a week. Over 2 hours a day fucking around killing computer generated genlocks and hurlocks.

I tell you what though, it was fun for a while. Learning about the Maker, killing the odd Ogre, having mass paralysis and firestorm spells, kicking arse anywhere I went, it was awesome. But then, I finished the game. In all of ~42 hours (including some pause time, where I would leave the game open to go to the *gasp* real world).

Why the long story, glasnt? Can't you just tell us what's wrong with the game without these Zero Punctuation-esk ramblings and occasional British swearing, you trouser wearing waffle nosher? Well, it just so happens that I am explaining myself. Just in the last sentence of the previous paragraph I identify two issues with the game, from which more will emerge.

42 hours to complete a game is bullshit. But I didn't complete it. I took a mage from start to Landsmeet (70% of the game, where all the parts come together before the final battle), got sick of getting her a ladder to get off her back (and failed to defeat Loghain), thereby restarting as a noble rouge. Having collected experience of the gameplay mechanics from my first run-through, I was able to choose a (less) annoying voice template and meander through the game like it was some ratmaze with shieks around the place.

The entire game is supposed to be 'Choose your Own Adventure', and yet the only 'choosing' you get to do is what order you gain allies in. Any other choice is strongly opposed by your companions, so much so that if they don't guilt trip you into choosing the 'right' option, they turn their back on you and then you're down a spirit healer (stupid Wynne and her Maker bullshit). Sure, it means that there is a discernable end, but maybe I want to join the blight and kill humanity with the darkspawn? But noooo, EA don't want me doing that.

And what's with the pause time counting towards gameplay hours? Sure, steam counts hours that the game is running, that's fine. Any more diagnostics collected by them with in-game play would be scary and probably publicly accessible. I do not want the world knowing how I play 90% of the time on Easy because I couldn't get out of the Dwarf Commoner storyline on Normal. When a game is paused, don't count it when it's over 5 minutes of no interaction, or something.

What's that I hear? You saw I mention my Easy Mode admittance and wonder why I then defer to another topic? Easy Mode is hard in itself. I'm not going to get any more satisfaction out of getting my arse handed to me by blight wolves, and there's no monetary, experience or achievement incentive to do so either. It doesn't extend or expand the game play, so why bother?

Also, what in jimminy cricket's name is up with the DLC? Just a few days ago they were selling DLC April Fool's gifts. I wasn't about to buy $5 worth of DLC points to try and see if I could purchase $2 of 'prank gifts and sorry gifts' just so I could 'explore the approval system further'. I know how to piss Morrigan off (the Slap Morrigan feature is quite a nice addon), and I know how to bed Alistiar. I get the approval system. And I already purchased every other DLC, Return to Ostagar, Stone Prisoner, Warden's Keep and Awakening, so I've blown enough money already.

'Awakening isn't a DLC', I hear those of you who are still with us mutter. Yes, Awakening is a fucking DLC. I am within my rights to call anything that costs $40 pre-order for 14 hours gameplay a DLC addon. It was completely shit. Sure, you could 'Play as a character from Orlias' (no-one knows you in the first 15 minutes of the game, no other difference), or you could 'Port your existing character!' (where they assume you've met everyone in the game, even if you haven't passed the Harrowing (yes I checked)).

I've spent hundreds of dollars, hundreds of dollars, and too much of my life on this peace of overpriced shit. Dragon Age has reminded me of when I got too involved in The Sims to find anything else after playing for a bit on the original PC version, even replaying the same game, was soulwrenching and disheartening.

I'm so going back to Team Fortress 2 now, casually. Humph.
