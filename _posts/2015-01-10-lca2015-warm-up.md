title: LCA2015 - Warm up
---

LCA2015 has it's bump-in/registration open as of tomorrow, and I'm getting a little bit excited. It's my first LCA, but I'll be jumping right in the deep end by presenting not just at a miniconf[0], but in the main conference[1] as well. 

If you are in attendance, please come and say hi. I'll also be dressing up for the Steampunk Penguin dinner. I hope you are too! If not, check the lca-chat mailing list for details about some steampunk buttons on sale, in case you lack flair.
