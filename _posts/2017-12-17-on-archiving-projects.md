title: On Archiving Projects
---

I've spoken about maintaining projects before, but I don't think I've written about it. 

For those who use GitHub, a relatively recent feature they've added is the ability to [archive projects](https://help.github.com/articles/about-archiving-repositories/). This allows you to mark a repo as read-only, and it actually means read-only. No issues, no pull requests, no comments. Nothing. 

While badges like [No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech) provide clear and concise documentation as to why a repo may not be touched any more, it doesn't stop people from raising bugs, trying to get code in, or having emails for those things pop up. Which keeps happening for some very old PowerShell code that doesn't even work on a version of Windows Server made in the last decade. 

This morning I've gone and marked a whole bunch of repos as Archived. 

This means the code still exists, it can be used within the bounds of the licence; it just means I won't be maintaining it any more.
