I was recently lucky enough to have been able to participate in a day-long workshop with the amazing [Damien Conway](http://damian.conway.org/About_us/Bio_general.html) courtesy of [Yow!'s Women in Tech competition](http://yownights.yowconference.com.au/). 

I learnt so much though Damien's mentoring, and the discussions with the other participants. 

I've collated all my notes, which are [available in full](https://github.com/glasnt/notes/tree/master/speakerworkshop). Alternatively, I have listed below the "TL;DR" below. 


	 - You are the post powerful person in the room. Do what you like, as long as it's good.
	 
	 - You know more than the rest of your audience. Teach them something.

	 - Don't distract your audience 
	  - wear dark clothes, no words on your shirt. Focus then falls on your hands, arms and face
	  - remove items, where possible. Clocks near projector screens are a disaster

	 - Get a clicker
	  - get one with a dongle and dedicated channel. 
	  - you cannot rely on the internet working, or a directional clicker

	 - There is nothing wrong with showing emotion
	  - communication happens at a emotional and intellectual level
	  - removing emotion cuts off communication

	 - Slides tips
	  - make them consistent
	  - make the tone in line with your tone (more emotive slides during more emotive areas)
	  - big words
	  - full screen pictures
	  - projector equipment will be awful, compensate

	 - Posture tips
	  - feet facing the audience, perhaps with one foot slightly forward
	  - hands should never touch body
	  - palms should face outward, and be inviting

	 - Presenter presentation
	  - make-up is ok, if it makes you comfortable and confident (also helpful if talk is recorded)
	  - hair - up is very formal, but just don't touch it during

	 - There is always more to learn
	  - after a talk, self evaluate, write down suggestions
