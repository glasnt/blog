Facebook has removed the 'is' from the Facebook status. This happened only a few hours ago, according to posts on the [Remove the "is" from the Facebook status (Official Facebook Petition)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2219762655/)

I wonder if it will be removed again... just like the thumbup/cross on the homepage, where you can hide/show items of a certain type..
