<p>I was looking around to see if there was a way to test if a ruby object was nil or empty in one test. Something like a <code>nempty?</code> (it's a working title of the function)</p>
<p>Turns out there is, called <code>blank?</code>, which returns true if something is an empty string, nil, and empty object, an empty array or one or many spaces.</p>
<p>This is implemented by overloading the String class. In Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>See, it's not a ruby method, it's a Rails method. Something that could be used in the wider community (other examples include <code>titleize</code>) but have been implemented in one library, which is gargantuan enough.</p>
<p>Surely others have ported this logic to helper gems, but it's just annoying to see such "vendor lock-in"(?) around in places that means it's harder to leave the ecosystem and just to the raw language constructs.</p>
<p>Or is this just a bunch of people creating helper functions in a much more accessible ecosystem? (Rails, with a presumably easier upgrade path (CVE's, anyone) vs Ruby itself, which has its whole 1.8 vs 1.9.x vs 2.x issues)</p>
