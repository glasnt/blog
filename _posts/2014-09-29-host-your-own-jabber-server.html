<p>Ever think "Gosh, I wish I had yet another service on my VPS that duplicates existing systems just so I can run it myself"? Disabled Google Plus and realized that it also takes out your Google Hangouts, and therefore Google talk?</p>
<p>Well, you could go back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci2bFFGM8T8">carrier pigeons</a>, or you could use your existing <a href="https://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> client and run a <code>ejabberd</code> server on your own VPS. <a href="http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/running-your-own-xmpp-server-debian-ubuntu/">Francois Marier </a>has some really good documentation on how to get this happening. I was able to follow that process on Wheezy.</p>
<p>One tip for those trying to set this up: the config file syntax is really important. If you try and start <code>ejabberd</code> and it fails (e.g. when trying to run <code>ejabberdctl</code>) make sure none of the old processes are running. Kill anything that looks like erlang in <code>ps aux</code> and then try restarting again. The logs in <code>/var/log/ejabberd</code> are helpful for the issues in the last restart, if it fails, but should you not get results in there, try restarting after clearing the server of related processes.</p>
