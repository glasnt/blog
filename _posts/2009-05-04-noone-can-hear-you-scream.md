So, you make a list, or have a rant about something. You place it on your website, be it LiveJournal, Myspace, your Blogspot or a seperate website all together. Will it get noticed? It depends where you put it.

A trend with social aggregaters like Digg and Reddit is that they will pick up content from known sites, such as TechCrunch, BoingBoing, etc, including all the newspaper websites, but they won't necessarily like what they see.

But unless you can get a continual flow of content into a format that people will see, like what they see, recommend it to their friends who will then spread the word, you're stuffed.
