Well, this has been another year. Not as many conferences or talks this year,
but according to TripIt, I've done 78,000kms and visited 8 countries.

Prior to this year, I've only spoken in Australia and New Zealand. That changed
when I got accepted to [DjangoCon
Europe](http://glasnt.com/blog/2016/04/03/djangocon-europe.html). Budapest was
fantastic, and the Django/Python community there was really welcoming.

I also had the opportunity to travel to [the US](https://glasnt.com/blog/2016/06/03/on-my-last-fortnight.html) for the first time, and speak at not one
but two conferences:
[PHP[tek]](http://glasnt.com/blog/2016/06/09/phptek-wrap-up.html) and [PyCon
US](http://glasnt.com/blog/2016/06/10/pycon-us-wrap-up.html). Getting to go to
two different conferences really helped me see how the US speaking scene was
cross these communities.

Being a speaker that brings in experience from outside the core community is a
honour and a privilege. Given my work in and around the Python ecosystem, I
identify more as a Python developer than I did a year ago, but it's not the only
thing that I do. So being able to be invited into the community for their flagship
conference is a true honour. And going to PHP[tek].. wow. I was stunned when
I heard that I was accepted. It was the first conference I'd been accepted to
that paid for speaker accomodation and flights. Eli and Heather were lovely, and
I'd love to come back again to another of their events.

I've also had [a talk that's never
been rejected](http://glasnt.com/blog/2016/07/18/on-acceptance-rates.html)[0].
That's been an interesting experience in itself, which I've written an entire
blog post on. It's also the first time I've been [invited to speak](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/2017)
 at a conference without having to submit a CFP.

On top of speaking internationally, I also have done a bunch of work behind the
scenes, organising my [own
conferences](http://glasnt.com/blog/2016/08/19/katieconf-2016-wrap-up.html) and
being on the council for [Linux Australia](https://linux.org.au), *and* doing a
bunch of
[beekeeping](http://glasnt.com/blog/2016/06/08/on-becoming-a-core-contributor.html)
as well this year.  I'm extremely grateful for the chance to give back to the
community in more ways than just speaking.  

On top of all of this, I'm going through some major life events, of which I've been
[public about](https://twitter.com/glasnt/status/785610827747299328), in so far as I've
said I am not okay. I have good days and I have bad days, but I'm getting there.

So I've had a busy year. I know it's not over just yet, but given I'm telling my
speaker story from October to October, and I don't have any other speaking engagements
until January next year, this is my year.

### feels time

Code of Conducts are bloody important. In the last year I've been on every side
of this. I've been a Code of Conduct representative, I've had to make a formal report,
and I've had a report made against me.

The Code is there for a reason. It's so that people have a framework of what is good
and what is not good, and how they can get help if they need it. Being on the conference
organiser end of this is hard. You have a document that says what behaviour is OK,
and short of levels of abuse that get law enforcement involved, it's a really delicate process
of working how what to do and how to handle the 'grey' situations. I've been doing
a bunch of work behind the scenes to try and make this process easier, but it's difficult.

That's why I'm extremely grateful to Ola and Ola for their [CoC Handbook](https://www.coc-handbook.com/),
which is an amazing guide as to how you can manage the physical handling of a Code of Conduct.

Guides like this as the next step in our evolution of Codes. It's no longer OK to just have a page
on your conference website that says "Be Excellent To Each Other". Having a process, and
following it, is the current standard that conferences need to have.

Self care is also extremely important. I wrote on this [after returning from Europe](http://glasnt.com/blog/2016/04/06/on-post-conference-care.html),
and it's hard to read back on that post now because I know exactly how I was feeling back then, and
it's all flooding back.

I am extremely grateful for the opportunities I've had in the last year. I truely am.
Best of all, I've spend time with wonderful people, and I hope I get to see
them again soon, but if not, they will be in my heart, always.

[0] The "‚ö°Ô∏èüòì‚ú®" talk has never been rejected. I've had to decline one offer
(travel), and a talk based on the same sort of content, but with a twist, was
rejected from a community well outside my usual haunts.
