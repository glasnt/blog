<p>Its the day before registration at the ACM ICPC Finals. We are in Banff. It was snowing and stuff still. Very very cold. I bought a beanie :)<br><br>Today&#39;s picture is a end of aisle display at Safeway in Banff. It was filled with Maple Syrup products.&nbsp; However, what&#39;s even more awesome is the french translation on the products - &quot;Sirop d&#39;erable&quot; (Syrup Terrible? Encreable!)<br>
