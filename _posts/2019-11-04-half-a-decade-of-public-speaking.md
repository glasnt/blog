Five years ago today I gave my first conference presentation.

Looking at those two talks, as a snapshot, a few things stand out. The same talk title, the same country, and the fact there's a bit of a gap between the normal November or December "first talk". But this one, is January. And yet I've still got a good baker's dozen talks in this year. 

This last year has been... 'rollercoaster' doesn't even begin to cover it. 

Two weeks after I got back from my last talk in last year's summary, I left my job. It was a combination of factors that lead to that decision, but one of the major ones was I was in a role where I was on-call remotely and not able to travel as much as I previously was, conference or no. I had to withdraw on a number of opportunities, and that wasn't going to work for me. I left without another job to go directly into. I was fortunate enough to in a position where I could do this, and I had options for small paid writing gigs in-between, but I didn't have a safety net of a new position to go directly into. That's scary. 

It's not the first time that my public speaking has led to major career disruption. I've given a keynote before, mentioning that time that I was let go six weeks after a presentation for my employer. For a few events there, I was attending purely for the joy of it, entirely of my own volition. 

The week I left my old employer, I got notification that I had been accepted to speak at PyCascades in Seattle, WA. I ended up being scheduled as the first talk of that event. The morning of the first day of PyCascades, I signed my contract with Google as a Developer Advocate on Google Cloud. I gave the talk I'd used in my interview at Google, in front of a crowd that included many of my now co-workers and peers.

And the last 7 months have been.. wow. 

I'm doing developer advocacy as a job now. I don't also have to be on-call, also have to be doing development, also having to be fixing the systems. I can just have one full-time job now. Speaking is no longer a gluttonous hobby. It's my career. 

And.. wow. 

It's really hard to describe the change of having to go from fighting to attend a conference, having to share accomodation, the flight on miles, and eating into your annual leave, all while representing your company; to being able to have entire systems - both people and technology - designed to help you make the most impact with your travel, to make your advocacy scale, to have *peers* to *collaborate* with. 

To have the work you do with and for the community you love be used to show how you are helping your employer *and* community at the same time, rather than hindering by being away for the odd week or two a quarter. 

I've been able to find ways to improve my presentations and "scalable advocacy" (Did You Know that you can blog and not have to get on a plane to present your ideas to an audience? It's True!). There is always a little happy you get when the thing you worked out from trial, error, and first principles turns out to be a stonkingly good idea. 

I'm able to take my experience and stories and failures and help people like me. As a job. 

And while my mum may not know what exactly it is I do, she at least knows who I work for. ðŸ˜†

I'm having a hard time trying to articulate just how proud and chuffed and thankful I am that I've been able to finally find a place where my skills and talents are not just tolerated, but appreciated and encouraged. 

Yes, one could say that I am still in my "honeymoon period" at this company. That same keynote mentioned earlier, I had just changed jobs, and I think I said something along the lines of "and it's pretty good, at the moment". Nothing is forever. I've been through the cycles a few times now. But right now, it's pretty good. 

Here's to another half decade. ðŸ’œ
