A few of the key take aways from the two days: 


### On Creating

Put something new into the existing formula for surprising results - Nigel Dalton

### On Team Dynamics

Combine devs and ops into different types of teams for different results - autobots, Project Gandalf, not just a black-box ops team - Javier Turegano

### On Continuous Deloyment

Optimise foor fast feedback, chunk your changes. Keep your changes as close to the metal as possible for efficiency. Timings can be just as ghetto as a `time(1)` grok out of log files, as long as you have the data. - Lindsay Holmwood

### On rising from the ashes

Break out session - test your backups. If your data center burns down and your backups are two months old, you're in for more hurt. 

### On Learnings

Learnings is a word just as much as devops is. 

### On version control 

Have some. - Will Thames


### On Learning

"Make sure you share. Make sure you celebrate. Make sure you demonstrate. Take your experiences with you." - @SteveElsewhere

### On Empathy

It doesn't just apply to devops. Empathy is important. Period. 

### On butt-selfie sticks

They exist. 

### On Ignite Talks

They are a baptism by fire. 

### On docker

It's ok if your containers die.

### On on-call

It's perferrable to get a unique interesting error at 3am then something that's preventable - Ali Graham

### On organising meetups

Share the load, order not just pizza, and get vendor/recruiter buy-in for venue choice.
