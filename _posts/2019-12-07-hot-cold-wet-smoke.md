I travel a lot. Mostly for work, but sometimes for fun. 

But in all my travels, all the adventures, all the listicles and vlogs I've read, if I can add just one piece of advice to the horde: pack for hot, cold, wet, and smoke. 

### Hot

Pack a pair of shorts. 

Even if you're travelling in winter. Even if you're sure you won't wear it. Pack shorts, just in case. 

Shorts are useful if you find yourself in a place where your long winter clothes are going to make you uncomfortable. Be that for lounging around, or if you end up unexpectedly overnighting in your layover destination that happens to be in the tropics (which has happened to me, twice, in the last six months)

### Cold

Pack a hoodie. 

Even if you're travelling in summer. Even if you're sure you won't wear it. Pack a hoodie, just in case. 

Hoodies are useful if you find yourself somewhere that's a bit chilly, such as a conference centre, or on a plane without sufficient blankets. If it's your only warm item, pack one that gives you comfort, be it zipped or non-zipped. 

### Wet

Pack a water-proof jacket.

Even if you're travelling in the desert. Even if you're sure you won't wear it. Pack a water-proof jacket, just in case. 

If not a full jacket, just a pocket poncho will help you when you end up in a downpour, or need something to take the edge off the harsh wind, or salt spray. 

### Smoke

Pack a decent face mask. 

Even if you're travelling where you don't think you'll need it. Even if you're sure you won't wear it. Pack a P2 (Australia), N98 (USA) or similar for your region. 

A mask packs down small, and can stay in your day back with that pocket poncho you got earlier.  Because if you do need one and you're travelling, everyone else will probably be looking for one too. So have one, just in case.
