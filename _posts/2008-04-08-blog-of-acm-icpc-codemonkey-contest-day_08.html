We had a 2.5 hour presentation from some of the best minds in the IBM business. There was a representative form Extreme Blue and other such projects. Then, the real fun (not that listening to business talks isn&#39;t fun). Columbian Icefields. It was really really pretty, but really really cold. I ended up trying to swim in the snow up to the glacier, but failed. There is video. I will not be releasing this to the public :P<br> <br>But yeah, seeing the rockies and standing on a glacier was cold but magical.<br><br>Tomorrow is the practice runs of the contest. We all need to be decked out in our team t-shirts and such. Then in the afternoon, a short activity - the Banff Hot Springs. Twill be interesting. Sub zero temperatures in togs. Mentos Ice anyone? &gt;_&gt;<br>
