<p>javascript: in functions, <code>x = 1</code> is not the same as <code>var x = 1</code>. The scoping of the variable is important in javascript. In one invocation, you can have local overloaded scope, the other you can't.</p>
<p>ruby; <code>x.each{}..</code> will not pass the manipulation should to the next function in the series. You want <code>x.map</code>.</p>
<p>This has been a public service annoucement for the "Not again" Society.</p>
<p>(Also, wordpress just said "Beep beep boop" to me using their new editor on Wordpress.com. :3)</p>
