title: RubyConf AU 2023 - Talk Roundup
---

[RubyConf AU 2023](https://rubyconf.org.au/2023) was held in Melbourne, on 16-17 February, and the videos were published very quickly,
thanks to [Next Day Video](https://nextdayvideo.com/). 

Instead of detailed notes for each talk (and this post is a week late as it is), I've instead collected the speaker details, video recording,
any references, and importantly: a single quote, pull out, or summary for each talk.
