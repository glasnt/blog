  We checked into the hotel (Fairmont Banff Springs) today. Its nice and castley, and it has all the amenities. Since we don&#39;t need to do anything until 6:30 (an hour ish from now) we walked back down to the town and had a scout around. McDonalds in Canada is the same as in Australia - tasteless. Although the waste recepticals are automated and say &#39;Thank you&#39; when you put your rubbish in them. And the post-mix machine has iced tea in it. And the salt packets contain sugar (dextrose). In our adventures we found a Dollar shop, and a radio shack. I also found JOLT cola at the Safeway (Woolworths). Its an energy drink that is 695ml of caffeinated goodness. 140mgs per serve apparently. Tastes good too. I&#39;ve heard that is an awesome drink, and its true. We haven&#39;t found any caffeinated Mountain Dew though. They only sell the caffeine-free variety here, like in Australia. The Americans will just have to keep it to themselves :P<br> <br>This post&#39;s picture is an image of the jolt I purchased, taken from the bridge over the river in Banff. <br>
