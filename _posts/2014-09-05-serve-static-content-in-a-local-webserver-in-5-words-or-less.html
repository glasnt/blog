<p>I've hit an issue where I want to view a copy of a website -- full of html, javascript, css, and what have you -- locally. This is fine, you can usually just go <code>file:///home/user/project/index.html</code>, and Bob's your uncle.</p>
<p>However, due to Chrome (and presumably Firefox) and their security limitations, you cannot use ajax calls locally. This means that a <code>$.get("file.txt",function(d){})</code> call in that local website directory you have won't work.</p>
<p>There are ways around this. You could convert the text in your <code>file.txt</code> into a javascript object and then parse that. But I like doing things in a non-destructive way. And I found it in an old <a title="&lt;3 StackOverflow" href="http://serverfault.com/a/8616/12173">serverfault post</a>. Simple invoke the power of python -</p>
<pre>python -m SimpleHTTPServer PORT</pre>
<p>Then you can have your cross-site scripting that's actually a localhost, and eat it too[0]</p>
<p>For Python3, use</p>
<pre>python -m http.server PORT</pre>
<p>The <code>-m</code> flag refers running a library module as a script. You can use this trick to do other cool things, like parsing pretty json to the terminal, using <code>python -m json.tool filename</code></p>
<p>NB. This post refers to "5 words or less" because</p>
<pre> $echo "python -m SimpleHTTPServer PORT"  | wc -w
 4
</pre>
<p>[0] Consumption of local webservers not recommended</p>
