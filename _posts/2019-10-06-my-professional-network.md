title: Why I won't connect with your Professional Network on LinkedIn
---

*This post serves to articulate my reasons for ignoring your LinkedIn connection.*

### I don't log into LinkedIn unless prompted

I have no regular reason to log into LinkedIn, apart from email notifications that I have a new pending connection. 

### I don't push to LinkedIn

I have personally found little to no value in posting content to LinkedIn, and the interface for seeing other's content is not useful for me. The content I get on the homepage on the rare occasion I do log in is often full of stale information. 


### I won't connect with you on LinkedIn if I don't know you. 

I appreciate it if you have seen me speak and want to connect. 

LinkedIn is not the platform for that. 

I am (as of writing) most active on Twitter, and I use that for a dual persona/professional network. 

My privacy settings on LinkedIn are such that you should be able to at least find me, but that doesn't give you open invitation to connect with me. 

### I will connect with you if we have a professional connection. 

If we have or do work together, then yes, I'll quite probably connect with you. 

If we have had nothing as much as a handshake, the chances I accept your connection are close to zero.
