Opening Ceremony: Overall Gist<br />Work in Canada. You guys are awesome. Help the Canadian economy. Work in Alberta. Work for IBM.<br /><br />Practice Sessions: Overall Gist<br />Lets try and submit a wrong answer. Then fix the code and submit the correct answer. This will give you a better understanding of the system. Only submit a solution to problem X based on your team number.<br />Result: Uni's submitting answers to every question. Clarifications flying around, with no real answers. And HTML markup in Java (I'm still trying to work that one out)<br /><br />Hot Springs: mmmm...<br /><br />(Yes, my post today is very in depth. The final is tomorrow, and I need sleepage. I shall expand if I feel like it)<br /><br />update: go go the all girl rockband team "(.Y.) \m/ \m/"<br />Yes, that was our name. :P
