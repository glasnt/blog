"Git submodule init requires perl. Cannot install Perl, am running CoreOS. Sadness."

I've been recently pushed head first into the land of CoreOS and Docker, attempting to get a consolidation of efforts together to get our Haskell project widgets in an automatically deployable, scalable state, and I hit this particular issue. 

CoreOS doesn't come with any [scripting languages](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant/issues/38#issuecomment-34584614). Which is a good thing, because it means CoreOS is very light. 

But it becomes an issue when executing `git submodule ...` requires Perl.

    $ git submodule init
    /usr/libexec/git-core/git-submodule: line 159: perl: command not found

So I thought "why is this so?", and executed a command I never thought I'd have to do: 

    git clone https://code.google.com/p/git-core/

A few minutes in the code base and I find that there's a little shell file called `git-submodule.sh` which has a function called `module_list` that embeds [raw Perl](https://code.google.com/p/git-core/source/browse/git-submodule.sh#159) in order to do some fancy pattern matching. This method is used by about half the functions in the file, so it's a little bit important. 

The [INSTALL](https://code.google.com/p/git-core/source/browse/INSTALL#102) file mentions that Perl is just in just a little bit of the system, but fails to mention this submodule limitation. 

The work around? `git clone <submodule repo>` in my repo. 

The actual fix? Work out how/if you can do the same sort of functionality in pure shell. 

Probaility of success - probably limited. 

It's always interesting, however, to see that even some of the fundemental Linux constructs are just shell, Perl and C all the way down.
