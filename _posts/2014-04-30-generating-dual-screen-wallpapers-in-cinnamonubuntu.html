<p>This stuff is really hard. (It might be easier on more consumer-friendly systems, but then you don't get things like a *nix OS (looking at you, windows))</p>
<p>You can easily do it by getting your (w x 2, h) sized wallpaper, and setting the Advanced Background settings to use "Spanned" Picture aspect setting, but how to do deal with multiple monitors that are different sizes?</p>
<p>The manual way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a screenshot of your system (Prnt-Sc).</li>
<li>Open in your favourite image editing suite</li>
<li>Take the left and right sides of your image, and scale them to the non-black areas of your screenshot</li>
<li>Save and use.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/media/cinnamon_before.png" alt="Original Image" width="300" height="84" /></p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/media/cinnamon_after.png"><img src="/assets/media/cinnamon_after.png" alt="Post Processed" width="300" height="139" /></a></p>
<p>(The setup I have has my laptop lower than my big screen, hence the disparity.</p>
<p>Now I'm thinking, how can I make this automatic using the system settings to resize and shift the smaller image...</p>
<p>Update: This method makes for a HORRIFIC lockscreen. The image that was spanned is then set as a default picture aspect, which ruins the effect :&lt;</p>
