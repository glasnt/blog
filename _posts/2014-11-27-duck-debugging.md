title: Duck Debugging
---

If you're not across the concept of "Rubber Duck Debugging", I suggest you [brush up](http://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/) on your knowledge.

Duck debugging is a very good tool, even if it's just a way to attempt to articulate your thoughts into words.

I've found too many times I'll be part way through a Stack Overflow post only to realise my issue and have another tangent to work from.

But this was solved once I acquired my own duck.

I love my duck.

Duck knows more about monoid burritos and the difference between Bourne and Bourne Again shells than any programmer I know. And it can listen to be blab on for hours about how silly compiler errors are.

Duck joins a long list of stuffed animals that adorn the desks of my current workplace, and was a welcome addition to the family.

I love my duck.
