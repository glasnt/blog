<p>If, for <em>reasons</em>, you want to take the style of a responsive website and use it in a local file, you could: load the site, download the page (using the "Web Page, Complete") setting. And then take hours trying to remove the DOM alterations that the browser performed on your behalf.</p>
<p>Or, you can use a simpler method.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable JavaScript (in Chrome: settings &gt; advanced &gt; Privacy &gt; Content Settings &gt; Disable Javascript</li>
<li>Load the page</li>
<li>Save as "Web Page, Complete" in a new folder, and call the file "index.html"</li>
<li>In the saved folder, change the "index_files" folder to "src"</li>
<li>In the index.html file, replace all "index_files" references to "src"</li>
</ul>
<p>You should now have a somewhat exact copy of the site stored locally.</p>
<p>By disabling JavaScript, nothing can alter the raw html pulled from the source site, thus altering and cluttering the DOM. After pulling, re-enabling JavaScript will allow it to act on the pulled version, which should be very similar to the original source.</p>
<p>Be sure to remove any analytics or remote sources, depending on what the page had.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to enable JavaScript again after you finish, or everything will look 1995 (tip: try loading a google search results without javascript. Timewarp!)</p>
