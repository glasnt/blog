title: "Quick Tip: Mass Renaming in MacOS Finder"
---

Did you know you can do mass renaming of folders and files in MacOS without having to learn regex?

You can select all files in a folder, and then right-click "Rename" to do search/replaces. 

But! You can also do this on nested folders. To do this the folders need to be visible, which mean you need to mass-expand them. Which you can do by selecting all, then pressing Command + Right Arrow (you'll need to select all again to select all the new files). 

You can also mass-collapse with Command + Left Arrow.
