Oh hey, I have another article up on [opensource.com](https://opensource.com), this time about my upcoming OSCON talk!

[Solving the cross-platform emoji problem](https://opensource.com/article/17/4/cross-platform-emoji)

(The article includes a code for discounted OSCON registration âœ¨)

I'm giving this talk at [YOW! West](http://west.yowconference.com.au/speakers/katie-mclaughlin/) and [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx/public/schedule/detail/56370) in the coming weeks. I hope to see you there!
