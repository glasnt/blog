<p><code>gnome-screenshot</code> ('Screenshot' in the unity launcher) has three modes - full screen, current window, and selected area. But did you know that by default in Ubuntu 14+ there are keyboard shortcuts for not one, not two, but all three?</p>
<p><code>PrtSc</code> for full desktop</p>
<p><code>Alt-PrtSc</code> for current window</p>
<p><code>Shift-PrtSc</code> for a selected area.</p>
<p>The first two will be familiar to Windows users, but the third keyboard shortcut is pretty cool too.</p>
<p>Except for the fact that you still have to use the mouse to select an area, so you can't go full keyboard ninja. Unless you have a cool keyboard based mouse movement system, then good for you!</p>
