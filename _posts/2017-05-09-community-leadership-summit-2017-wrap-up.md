This past weekend I was fortunate enough to keynote the Community Leadership Summit (CLS) in Austin, Texas

It was an absolute pressure cooker of amazing community leaders, all discussing a range of topics across many fields. 


This post serves as a braindump of some of those conversations.

Think about why you run events. 

Is it for generating revenue for your product/community, to then spend in other places? Is it to create an environment of like-minded people to meet and network and create?

More on stickers:

 * If you're creating hex stickers, [stick to the standard](http://hexb.in/sticker.html)
 * Choose automotive grade vinyl

T-shirts

 * Not everyone will want a t-shirt, anyway. 
 * Sizing charts being accessible on your conference website, including measuring guides, are a thing
 * Heavy cotton is more expensive, but is less likely to be completely seethrough
 * Direct to garment (digital) printing is less durable than screenprinting. May only last a few washes, but is cheaper for smaller batches
 * Screen printed shirst last longer, but are more expensive. Involves making physical screens for each colour on the shirt, more colours -> more screens -> more money. 
 * Don't use white shirts. They are epic see-through, and don't get the white-drop background colour first (normally)
 * Many manufacturers don't have all colours in all sizes and all cuts
 * Consider having straight, semi-fitted, and fitted shirts
 * Cotton Bureau [Blank](https://blank.cottonbureau.com/) might be interesting, watch this space

Running world class events

 * Run regular organisational team meetings in scrum style, increasing in frequency as the conference approaches
 * Documentation should be shared across organisational teams across years
 * Selling out tickets is OKAY
 * Check the interfaith calendar before booking dates
 * Have efficiency in your on-site registration process
 * Ensure your breakout areas don't echo
 * Have an event the day before your conf. ENSURE IT'S ADVERTISED (people flying in will miss it, otherwise)
 * Have dry (alcohol freee) options for your social events
 * Consider having a video and translator sponsor
