Daniele Procida, [Abstract](https://cfp.2021.djangocon.eu/2021/talk/SPQP39/)

"Most software is substandard because programming is intrinsically enjoyable." - [tweet](https://twitter.com/glasnt/status/1399989771431137284)

Highly recommend watching the playback.

From the Q&A: "I'd hate people to think I'm "anti-fun". I mean, I am, but I don't want people to think that!"
