Over the Easter long weekend, I was lucky enough to get my hands on a raspberry. A few in fact. Here is my review: 

## Hardware

Actually getting a raspberry is hard. There are a lot of prickles in trying to obtain the little gem of goodness from the manufacturer. I was able to get around this by letting my fingers do the walking, and getting my hands dirty, to secure the best bargain.

## Software

The great thing about raspberries is they respond really well to software. I was able to add a little bit of sugar coating to the default operating system to releave some of the tartness of the original system, and it came out a treat.

## Casing

The main problem is that there is no default casing for the pie. There are some tried and true home methods, which I ended up opting for over a store-bought, pre-rolled version. I did try and add some embellishments to the top casing for ventilation, with varying effect. 

## Overall performance

These little nuggets of goodness are just as good as they look. If you aren't careful they can be a little tart, but overall, they provide a burst of sweet, sweet delicious goodness to your arsenal..

## Build specs

#### Internals 
300g fresh raspberries
2 tsp caster sugar
2 tsp plain flour

#### Casing

 * BYO Store Casing,

or DIY

 * 225g plain flour
 * 1/4 tsp salt
 * 30g caster sugar
 * 125g butter, cold, cubed
 * 1 egg

### Assembly

*If going DIY casing, follow your assembly instructions, or use my TL;DR: sift dry ingredients + sugar,  and rub butter into this mixture. The result should resemble breadcrumbs. Cut in one egg, roll the dough into a disc, and refrigerate for one hour*

Preheat the oven to 180C

Combine berries, flour and sugar in a bowl, and leave for a few minutes to let the liquid seep out of the berries. They will take on am amazing luxurious texture. 

Form pie casings and fill with berry mix. Be careful not to overfill, as there will be leakage from the delicious bubbling sugar gloop.

Form a top of the casing however you wish - lattice work, strips of pastry, or a circle with a vent hole. 

Sprinkle with sugar for that fancy cafe look before baking.

Bake for 25 minutes until golden and smelling amazing. 

Serve hot or cold, with icecream and/or a good cup of tea.
