<p>If you need to win an argument and you have a severely throttled internet connection, or you're on 3G, try this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring up an interface that will allow you to run <code>dig</code> (e.g. an ssh into a machine, or a sufficiently able terminal session on your mobile)</li>
<li>run <code>dig +short txt [query].wp.dg.cx</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You'll get the first ~400 characters of the wikipedia page in a DNS txt record, which should be sufficient to win the most basic word definition debates brought up on car trips.</p>
<p>Using the mobile wikipedia page can take several hundred kilobytes of data transfer but using this method I was able to ssh into my personal server and get the wiki information in a tenth of the time, and all for the low, low cost of 6 kilobytes.</p>
