In one of the many new and interesting things that I learnt this week, I discovered that you can use the hash-bang operator not only to make a file run with a specific system binary (e.g. `#!/bin/bash`) but with any executable file, even if it's local, just like the example below: 


    $ cat myfile
    #!./interpret
    hai there

    $ cat interpret
    #!/usr/bin/env python        												 
    import sys        
																 
    input = open(sys.argv[1]).read()
    print("File contains %s" % (input.splitlines()[1:]));

    $ ./myfile
    File contains ["hai there"]


The same interpretor functionality in ruby would be something along the lines of

    $ cat ruby_interpret
    #!/usr/bin/ruby
    input = File.readlines(ARGV[0])
    puts "File contains: #{input[1..-1]}"

In both cases, the interpreter gets the command line argument via unix-black magic, reads in the file, and echos it's contents to stdout, purposefully skipping the first line in both cases.
