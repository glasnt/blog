<dt>What does 'glasnt' mean?</dt>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0">Back in the days of the Cold War, American secret service personnel has to be very careful about
 how they approached and contacted one another in public, the codename normally chosen was "Joe" 
being a very All-American name by which one could identify with any covert agent by saying "Hi Joe". 
Obviously this alone isn't enough to ensure the other person isn't just called Joe so the typical 
response would be "Hi Glasnt". 
</P><p>
The origin of glasnt has been broadly discussed, some people think it's 
short hand for "glad the country hasn't been attacked" or derived from the acronym "Generally low 
activity seriousness, no threats". At any rate, the phrase became something of a meme amongst former 
secret service/intelligence members as the codeword fell out of use but was held onto for nostalgia's sake. 
</p><p>
As for Joee and Glasnt on the forums, if you think they're just some kids trawling around on here reading
comics, it's time to wake up and see how far down the rabbit hole goes...</p>
